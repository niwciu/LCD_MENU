# PROJECT CUSTOM TARGETS FILE
#  here you can define custom targets for the project so all team member can use it in the same way
#  some example of custo targets are shown bello those are targets for:
# 		1. Running unit tests
# 		2. Code Complexity Metrics
# 		3. CppCheck static analize of specific folder
# 		4. Code Coverage report generation.
